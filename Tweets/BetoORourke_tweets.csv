Only that truth will allow us to begin to repair the damage done"
1112044381685600261,2019-03-30 17:30:16,If we believe in real justice reform in the face of the largest prison population on the face of the planet — one disproportionately comprised of people of color — let us not just end the prohibition of marijuana but expunge the record of those arrested solely for possession.
1112044038780260354,2019-03-30 17:28:54,"Let’s ensure everyone can succeed regardless of their family dynamics, their gender, their sexual orientation or their race. Paid family leave. Equal pay for women. No discrimination in the workplace, and access to capital for communities that have been shut out for generations."
1112043870299348994,2019-03-30 17:28:14,"Let’s support rural America by listening to and partnering with rural communities on infrastructure, schools, hospitals, &amp; broadband. Let’s make sure farmers can make a profit while they grow the food &amp; fiber that feeds and clothes not just this country, but so much of the world."
1112043561460133888,2019-03-30 17:27:00,Let’s not diminish the power of unions in this country. Let's strengthen unions in this country and ensure a path to apprenticeships and careers. Guarantee that one job is enough by paying every working American a true living wage.
1112043446439735297,2019-03-30 17:26:33,"Let’s graduate young women and men from high school who are career ready as well as college ready, able to pursue debt-free higher education or a job that provides purpose and a real paycheck. We can do this."
1112043302394753025,2019-03-30 17:25:58,"If we believe in an economy that works for all, then let us invest in a world class Pre-k through 12 public education system and ensure that we are paying our educators a living wage so that they don’t have to work a second or third job."
1112043213051883521,2019-03-30 17:25:37,"This means every one of us is able to afford our prescriptions, see a doctor, take our children to a therapist. No one priced out. No one denied care. No one left behind. Universal, guaranteed, high quality health care must be achieved as quickly and as surely as possible."
1112042948177350656,2019-03-30 17:24:34,"Universal healthcare means everyone gets primary healthcare, mental healthcare — and universal care also means that every woman makes her own decisions about her own body."
1112042815192731648,2019-03-30 17:24:02,"If we believe in universal, guaranteed, high quality healthcare - because we see the consequences to our fellow Americans who go without - then let us come together around a solution."
1112042614742835201,2019-03-30 17:23:14,These challenges and the threats to our democracy cannot be met by half measures or with only half the country. It’s gonna take all we’ve got and it’s gonna take all of us.
1112042556257374209,2019-03-30 17:23:00,"The differences between us — where we live, who we love, to whom we pray, how long our families have been in this country, the color of our skin, the party to which we belong — those differences cannot be allowed to define us or divide us now. Let us be Americans first."
1112042150538211328,2019-03-30 17:21:24,"A vigorous democracy - both economic and political - is the only check on the inertia of power, on the corruption and capture of our institutions, and the only means to elevate the voices and lives of our fellow Americans."
1112042051821072385,2019-03-30 17:21:00,"Unrestrained, money and influence have warped this country’s priorities and its very democracy. It has corrupted our democracy. It has invited cynicism, distrust and disengagement from Americans who see a government in thrall to those who can pay for access and outcomes."
1112041843733209089,2019-03-30 17:20:10,"For too long in this country, the powerful have maintained their privilege at the expense of the powerless. They have employed fear and division — based on differences in race or ethnicity, geography and faith — to keep us apart, and angry and afraid of one another."
1112041745775243265,2019-03-30 17:19:47,The challenges before us are the biggest of our lifetimes. Millions without healthcare; an economy that works too well for too few and not at all for too many; &amp; the opportunity to avert the worst consequences of climate change fading in the face of our inaction. We must overcome
1112041587712950273,2019-03-30 17:19:09,"Like so many of you, Amy and I have decided that at this moment of truth we must give it our all. This moment is our test - the generations that follow ours, the people of the future, are counting on us - and we cannot be found wanting."
