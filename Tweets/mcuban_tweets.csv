The bad news is that decades of institutional politics and pressure from former refs is making change difficult if not impossible.  It didn't help that they took officiating out of the NBA committee that I was part of. Wonder Why

All of these are because of lack of professional  management and training development skills Stu.The good news is that we have replaced basketball lifers who ""failed up"" to become head of officials"
1123227165875740673,2019-04-30 14:06:39,"Or finding ourselves in a position where despite more than half of officials making the playoffs each year, we have officials who went 10, 15 or more years never having made the playoffs and we don't have officials trained and ready to replace them, so they keep their jobs"

1123227164160208897,2019-04-30 14:06:39,Then of course there was the hiring.  The years where we hired because someone went to a camp run by a working official !!! Or people from small college conferences were hired because the conference head of refs was the college coach of the NBA head of officials.
1123227163166162944,2019-04-30 14:06:38,"The overwhelming influence of internal politics . I've been hearing from NBA refs for 20 years. All complain about the politics.  About how being an Ed Rush guy, a Philly guy , a this guy or that guy,  how assignments  were subjective and driven by politics"
1123227162256052226,2019-04-30 14:06:38,"None of this makes it an easy job. What it does make officiating is a profession that is crying out for professional management and training.

1123227161513660416,2019-04-30 14:06:38,"Officiating is unique as profession. There is a set rulebook, case book, video of everything , instant replay to correct mistakes, a limited pool of fewer than 70 professionals, an off season to improve . That makes it far easier to study than almost any other profession Stu"

1122946604825239552,2019-04-29 19:31:48,You don‚Äôt have to be a former nba player to coach or do player development. There is a long list of professions where the best training and management comes from those whose core competency is training and managing people.  Officiating is no different.  #endofrant
1122946603642433537,2019-04-29 19:31:48,"IMO, one of the core problems of the group is the belief that only former officials know how to train current officials and identify and develop  new talent.  I couldn‚Äôt disagree more."

1122946600740052992,2019-04-29 19:31:47,"And of course there is just as much turnover in those positions, mostly driven by politics , as there has been with the head of officiating spots."
1122946599901171713,2019-04-29 19:31:47,"We have our former big name officials spending most of their time working with current  NBA refs, and minimal time with GLeauge refs.  It should be the exact opposite.  Does anyone think refs with 20 years + experience are going to take advice from their former peers ?"

1079452195920244736,2018-12-30 19:00:33,"That said, my kids friends don‚Äôt know anything about OWL and their use of black ops, OW and all but rocket league has disappeared. Anecdotal, but it keeps me digging to learn more about what 7 to 15 year olds are doing with their time so I can earn more and more of it"
1079452194217361410,2018-12-30 19:00:33,"True. The reality is that the expansion of Gaming/ESports is a threat to traditional sports fandom. 9 year olds know more about fortnite than the NBA, which means I have to work harder to support youth basketball and grow it in a manner that connects young kids to the NBA https://t.co/ZuWqJbH4pn"

1079450565665570817,2018-12-30 18:54:04,"ESports Teams, particularly in the states are now a VC/Investor backed industry.  It‚Äôs beyond rare for investors to give huge valuations to companies that don‚Äôt own their IP."

1078530495116443648,2018-12-28 05:58:02,The core  issue is that the games change.  With each change every team has to practice as a unit and consider every permutation.
