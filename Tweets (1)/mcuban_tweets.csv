1280646783434031104,2020-07-07 23:36:01,@JoeTalkShow It usually helps to ask the major players what they will do before you sign the deal. And the idea that a trade balance is negative is crazy. But to be expected from our President who still thinks China is paying for the tariffs. There were some improvements. These aren’t them.

1200068398736171008,2019-11-28 15:06:17,@AndrewMarchand This has been a theme from critics for at least 20 years. When ratings were up there were too many games or they would be higher. When they were down there were too many games.
